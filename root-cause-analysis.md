# ItemSeek Build Failure Root Cause Analysis

## Executive Summary

After deep analysis, I've identified multiple issues causing build failures:

### 1. **Project Confusion**
- You have TWO different ItemSeek projects:
  - `/Users/kyleburns/itemseek` - A monolithic Next.js app with Clerk auth
  - `/Users/kyleburns/itemseekapp` - A micro-app architecture with pnpm workspaces
- The server is running the micro-app version, but some fixes were applied to the wrong project

### 2. **Git Merge Conflicts**
- **Root Cause**: Files contain unresolved merge conflict markers
- **Evidence**: `apps/tasks-app/app/layout.tsx` has `<<<<<<< HEAD` markers
- **Impact**: JavaScript/TypeScript parser fails on these markers

### 3. **Missing Build Dependencies**
- **Root Cause**: `packages/api-client` lacks build dependencies on server
- **Evidence**: No `dist` folder created after build attempts
- **Missing**: `tsup`, `typescript`, `@types/node` dev dependencies

### 4. **Workspace Dependency Issues**
- **Root Cause**: Some apps missing `@itemseek/api-client` in dependencies
- **Evidence**: "Module not found: Can't resolve '@itemseek/api-client'"
- **Affected**: tasks-app, locations-app, api-gateway

### 5. **Build Order Problem**
- **Root Cause**: Apps trying to build before their dependencies
- **Evidence**: Apps can't find api-client because it hasn't been built yet
- **Solution**: Must build packages before apps

## Verified Issues on Server

1. **Merge Conflicts** - CRITICAL
   - Files have Git conflict markers breaking the parser
   - Must be resolved before ANY build can succeed

2. **Missing api-client dist** - HIGH
   - Package exists but isn't built
   - Server missing build tools (tsup)

3. **Incorrect transpilePackages** - MEDIUM
   - Some apps don't include all workspace packages

## Recommended Fix Sequence

1. **Clean merge conflicts first**
   ```bash
   grep -rl "<<<<<<< HEAD" . --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | xargs -I {} sed -i '/<<<<<<< HEAD/,/=======/d; />>>>>>> /d' {}
   ```

2. **Install build dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd packages/api-client
   pnpm add -D tsup typescript @types/node
   ```

3. **Build in correct order**
   ```bash
   # Build packages first
   pnpm build --filter "./packages/*"
   # Then build apps
   pnpm build --filter "./apps/*"
   ```

4. **Restart services**
   ```bash
   pm2 restart all
   ```

## Prevention

1. Always pull before making changes
2. Resolve merge conflicts immediately
3. Ensure build dependencies are in package.json
4. Use `pnpm build` at root level to respect workspace order
5. Test builds locally before deploying
